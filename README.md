# Bubble IO

## A simple number finder game in which you have to find the hit number. Game runs for a total of 60 seconds and the for each correct hits you make, the score increments by 10. This web game is responsive in design but at some window sizes, the design still breaks and needs some work. Simple functionality is achieved and I plan to add other features
in the future.
